        django-uni-form (django-uni-form)
        =====================================
        
        Django_ forms are easily rendered as tables,
        paragraphs, and unordered lists. However, elegantly rendered div based forms
        is something you have to do by hand. The purpose of this application is to
        provide a simple tag and/or filter that lets you quickly render forms in a div
        format.
        
        `Uni-form`_ has been selected as the base model for the design of the forms.

        =============
        
        The maintainers of django-uni-form are committed to providing a fully tested
        suite of functionality for developers to use. Therefore, all submissions must
        come with either unit tests or browser views of functionality as is 
        demonstrated in the test projects. Inclusion of both will increase the likely
        hood of your pull request being accepted
